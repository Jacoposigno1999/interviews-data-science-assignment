# Data Science Interview Assignment

## Introduction

If you read this file, you were successful in the behavioural interview. Well done! :clap: :clap: :clap:

:rocket: The next step to join the Data Science team of [xtream](https://xtreamers.io) is this assignment. 
You will find several datasets: please choose **only one**.
For each dataset, we propose several challenges. You **do not need to
complete all of them**, but rather only the ones you feel comfortable about or the ones that interest you. 

:sparkles: Choose what really makes you shine!

:watch: We estimate it should take less than 8 hours to solve the challenges for a dataset, and we give you **10 days** to submit a
solution, so that you can move at your own pace.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Important**: you might feel the tasks are too broad, or the requirements are not
fully elicited. **This is done on purpose**: we wish to let you take your own way in 
extracting value from the data and in developing your own solutions.

### Deliverables

Please fork this repository and work on it as if you were taking on a real-world project. 
On the deadline, we will check out your work.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Important**: At the end of this README, you will find a blank "How to run" section. 
Please write there instructions on how to run your code.

### Evaluation

Your work will be assessed according to several criteria, for instance:

* Method
* Understanding of the data
* Completeness and clarity of the results
* Code quality
* Work quality (use of git, dataset management, workflow, tests, ...)
* Documentation

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Important**: this is not a Kaggle competition, we do not care about model performance.
No need to get the best possible model: focus on showing your method and why you would be able to get there,
given enough time and support.

### Diamonds

**Problem type**: regression

**Dataset description**: [Diamonds readme](./datasets/diamonds/README.md)

Don Francesco runs a jewelry. He is a very rich fellow, but his past is shady: be sure not to make him angry.
Over the years, he collected data from 5000 diamonds.
The dataset provides physical features of the stones, as well as their value, as estimated by a respected expert.

#### Challenge 1

**Francesco wants to know which factors influence the value of a diamond**: he is not an expert, he wants simple and clear messages.
However, he trusts no one, and he hired another data scientist to get a second opinion on your work.
Create a Jupyter notebook to explain what Francesco should look at and why.
Your code should be understandable by a data scientist, but your text should be clear for a layman.

#### Challenge 2

Then, Francesco tells you that the expert providing him with the stone valuations disappeared.
**He wants you to develop a model to predict the value of a new diamond given its characteristics**.
He insists on a point: his customer are not easy-going, so he wants to know why a stone is given a certain value.
Create a Jupyter notebook to meet John's request.

#### Challenge 3

Francesco likes your model! Now he wants to use it. To improve the model, Francesco is open to hire a new expert and 
let him value more stones.
**Create an automatic pipeline capable of training a new instance of your model from the raw dataset**. 

#### Challenge 4

Finally, Francesco wants to embed your model in a web application, to allow for easy use by his employees.
**Develop a REST API to expose the model predictions**.

## How to run

Non dovrebbero essere necessarie particolari istruzioni per eseguire il codice.

Nella repository è presente un file 'envirionment.yml' con tutte le librerie che ho usato 

Nel file Task_1_and_2 alcune righe di codice sono commentate, possono servire se si vogliono avere ulteriori informazioni sui dati con cui si sta lavorando.

Attenzione: Nel file Task_3_pipeline, nel paragrafo **Pipeline for numerical features** se si scommenta #('remove_error', RemoveError()), la pipeline non funzionerà.
